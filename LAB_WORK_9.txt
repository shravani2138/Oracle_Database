1. Write a procedure which accept the account number of a customer and retrieve the balance.

create PROCEDURE GetAccountBalance(IN account_number INT, OUT balance DECIMAL(10, 2))
BEGIN
    select account_balance INTO balance
    from accounts

CALL GetAccountBalance(12345, @balance);
select @balance;

2. Write a procedure which accept the deptno and print minimum salary of employee working in that department.

create PROCEDURE GetMinSalaryByDept(IN dept_no INT)
BEGIN
    DECLARE min_salary DECIMAL(10, 2);
    
    select MIN(salary) INTO min_salary
    from employees
    where department_id = dept_no;

    select min_salary AS Minimum_Salary;
END;

To execute the second 
CALL GetMinSalaryByDept(10);

3. Write a function which accept a deptno and check whether it is present in dept Table or not. If it is present print number of employees working in that department.

create FUNCTION CheckDeptAndCountEmployees(IN dept_no INT) RETURNS INT
BEGIN
    DECLARE employee_count INT;

    IF EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM departments WHERE department_id = dept_no) THEN
        
        select COUNT(*) INTO employee_count
        from employees
        where department_id = dept_no;

        RETURN employee_count;
    ELSE
        RETURN 0; 
    END IF;
END;

To use the function:

select CheckDeptAndCountEmployees(10);
