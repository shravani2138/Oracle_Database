Q2. Consider the following schema:
Sailors (sid, sname, rating, age)
Boats (bid, bname, color)
Reserves (sid, bid, day(date))

Write SQL statements for the following query.

1. Find all information of sailors who have reserved boat number 101.

select * from Sailors
where sid IN(select sid from reserves where bid = 101);

2. Find the name of boat reserved by Bob.

select B.bname
from Boats B
JOIN Reserves R ON B.bid = R.bid
JOIN Sailors S ON R.sid = S.sid
where S.sname = 'Bob';

3. Find the names of sailors who have reserved a red boat, and list in the order of age.

select DISTINCT S.sname
from Sailors S
JOIN Reserves R ON S.sid = R.sid
JOIN Boats B ON R.bid = B.bid
where B.color = 'red'
ORDER BY S.age;

4. Find the names of sailors who have reserved at least one boat.

select DISTINCT S.sname
from Sailors S
JOIN Reserves R ON S.sid = R.sid;

5. Find the ids and names of sailors who have reserved two different boats on the same day.

select R1.sid, S.sname
from Reserves R1
JOIN Reserves R2 ON R1.sid = R2.sid AND R1.bid <> R2.bid AND R1.day = R2.day
JOIN Sailors S ON R1.sid = S.sid
GROUP BY R1.sid, S.sname;

6. Find the ids of sailors who have reserved a red boat or a green boat.

select DISTINCT S.sid
from Sailors S
JOIN Reserves R ON S.sid = R.sid

8. Count the number of different sailor names.

select COUNT(DISTINCT sname) AS different_sailor_names
from Sailors;

9. Find the average age of sailors for each rating level.

select rating, AVG(age) AS average_age
from Sailors
GROUP BY rating;

10. Find the average age of sailors for each rating level that has at least two sailors.

select rating, AVG(age) AS average_age
from Sailors
GROUP BY rating
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 2;
